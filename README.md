[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/APEMENdelights-PRVLUTION/bootstrap-4-simple-starterkit-for-beginner.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

Having problems to customize Bootstrap4? Reaching out for a simple starterkit to convert scss without using webpack? 
Use this easy-in-use starterkit with auto prefix and css/scss compiling. I tried to handle all actionss included inside
the package.json by using simple scripts. I hope it will be helpful for you! Have fun!  

## GET STARTED
1. Clone the project using `git clone`
2. Go to the project root directory using `cd yourprojectname`
3. Run `yarn install` to setup node_modules

## PRODUCTION

Run available scripts single or use `yarn bob` to run 'em all

   `yarn css`       = convert css to sass using autoprefixer

   `yarn ugly`      = minify css
   
   `yarn sass`      = minify sass

   `yarn min`       = minifiy css and sass 

   `yarn  bob`      = run all scripts sequently
